# HumanTopography

For this assignment I wanted to explore something more artistic than code heavy. I was interested in the idea of land topography being mirrored in human topography. I created an automated program that would use the brightness values of a portrait to overlay nature photos where the elevation of the pictured landform would correlate to the brightness in the portrait's pixels.

Here is a smaller version of one of the prints:
